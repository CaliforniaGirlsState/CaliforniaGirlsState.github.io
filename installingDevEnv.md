+ First we need node and npm. Installing node itself is the easiest way to get node. So go to https://nodejs.org/en/, and download the installer for your platform. Install it, then verify npm is installed by simply typing 
```shell
npm -v
```
+ You will see version on your screen. npm stands for Node Package Manager, and it's a bit like a super powered tool installer. Because it is so powerful, many tools, Ionic included, use it as an installer. 

+ To install Ionic, we first need to install the Apache Cordova CLI. The command is,  
```shell
npm install -g cordova
```

+ The -g means global, i.e. make it a command line tool that we can use anywhere. Then, do the same thing with Ionic.
```
npm install -g ionic
```

+ Now, to verify things are setup correctly, just type on the terminal 
```
ionic 
```
+ and we should get the help screen telling about all the various options. Ionic is now installed and ready to be use :+1: :smiley:
